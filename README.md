# music-visualization
A system to visualize music with LEDs.

This project handles both the analysis of the music and the representation of its mood.
The implementation first extracts several features from music.
These are then displayed with the aid of various forms of visual designs using LEDs.

The system is made for RaspberryPi.
It implements the [Essentia-Library](https://github.com/MTG/essentia).
